# Research
These are some projects that have been successful. The older ones will be summarised in a blog later, they are quite long, I got excited about writing about my first projects and they may be too long. It is also easier to correct mistakes that I made and misunderstandings that I had, than rewrite everything.

## Comparing model confidence using noise
Comparing the confidence of models trained with different cost functions and final layers by looking at how well they distinguish noise from legitimate inputs.

---

## Combatting and detecting FGSM and PGD adversarial noise
Testing pre-trained pruned models against the RobustML framework for robustness and confidence estimates.

---

## [Output analysis](/output_analysis_article)
This blog looks at the output values of models used in blog 1. Outputs can be used to assess the quality of the images,

## [Pruning, cost functions and adversarial noise](/article_pruning)
My first blog, where I have changed the cost function and pruned weights using 2 different methods. I will link here soon to a blog summarising this so nobody has to read that much.
