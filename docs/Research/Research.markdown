# Research
These are some projects that have been successful. 

---

## Comparing model confidence using noise
Comparing the confidence of models trained with different cost functions and final layers by looking at how well they distinguish noise from legitimate inputs.

---

## Combatting and detecting FGSM and PGD adversarial noise
Testing pre-trained pruned models against the RobustML framework for robustness and confidence estimates.

---

## Output analysis
This blog looks at the output values of models used in blog 1. Outputs can be used to assess the quality of the images,

## Pruning, cost functions and adversarial noise
My first blog, where I have changed the cost function and pruned weights using 2 different methods.
