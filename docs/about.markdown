# About Me

I am a self taught machine learning hobbyist. I studied maths years ago. I started studying machine learning when it was new and exciting, now it is just a bit less new, but there are still exciting things going on. 

# About My Research

My research is whatever I find interesting, and can do on my home PC. Read about this in the blogs section. 

### Contact Me

If you have a need to contact me, try email, I am not on twitter, and don't want to use facebook. Email works, email is fine, you don't need to see pictures of me on holiday to talk about machine learning. james.gannon.82@gmail.com
