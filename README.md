# JNGANNON In development

This is my new site, better laid out, and more contributions from me.

## Research

This is stuff that has been a success.

## Projects

This is stuff that could turn into research, stuff that has failed/not succeeded yet

## Software stuff

The packages I built to help me,

### Parana
The old one made on tensorflow

### Sparana 
Made without tensorflow so I can use sparse matrices, more memory control and stuff.

### Blog

An informal blog of things that I don't want to put in formal research posts.

### [About me](/about/)
